<pre>According to Moses&apos; view in chapter twenty, there was much trouble and iniquity among God&apos;s people, but in God&apos;s view there was neither trouble nor iniquity.

</div>

<div class="literalblock">

<pre>We should not offend other saints or stumble them. Whenever we are offended or stumbled, we should be forgiving. If we know only to condemn others and have no intention of forgiving them, we will have trouble. In the church life there is the need of forgiveness.</pre>

<pre>The lesson we need to learn from Moses&apos; failure in Numbers 20 is that we should be very careful when we speak about God&apos;s people. We may think that we are right and that others are wrong. However, God may come in not to vindicate us but to vindicate the ones we condemn.</pre>

<p>7.. The Significance of the Types</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The problem in Numbers 20 was due to the lack of the Spirit of life. This indicates that whenever God&apos;s people are short of the Spirit of life, they will have trouble.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>To &quot;take the rod&quot; is to apply the death of Christ to ourselves. In striking the rock a second time, Moses made a serious mistake. This act was against God&apos;s economy. In God&apos;s economy Christ should not be crucified more than once.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Christ was crucified under the rod of the law, and now He is the following rock, the life-giving Spirit.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>To have the living water, we simply need to take the rod and apply it to our situation today. We also need to speak to the rock. Speaking to the rock is a matter of believing. Furthermore, speaking to the rock indicates that we have prayed, not in the way of begging but in the way of believing that the Spirit has already been given.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The problems in the church life are solved when we have an abundance of the Spirit of life. The problems between us and others and between us and God are due to our shortage of the Spirit of life. T</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>it is not sufficient for us simply to be right with God; we must also be right in our attitude toward God&apos;s people.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In order to be right in our attitude, we must know God&apos;s nature. We need to realize that in His nature God is fair, bountiful, rich in supply, loving, gracious, and merciful. Whenever we see something in God&apos;s people which, to our view, is not right, we need to consider the situation according to God&apos;s nature.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>To receive this supply, there is no need for us to beg or even to pray. We should simply speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Today we do not need to beg Him for living water or wait for Him to supply us with water. We just need to come to Him and say, &quot;Lord, I need Your Spirit. Lord, give me the Spirit of life.&quot;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Whenever we speak to Christ as the rock, telling Him to give us living water, we must have the rod in our hand. This means that as we speak to the rock, we must apply the death of Christ to ourselves and realize that we are crucified persons.</pre>

<li>
<p>Because the Way Was Hard, the People Being Impatient and Speaking against God and Moses, Mainly concerning the Food Supply</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>From God&apos;s point of view, this contending, unlike the contending for water, was not fair. God had not promised that the way through the wilderness would be easy. They should have anticipated a difficult journey. Therefore, God was not happy with them and He punished them.</pre>

<div class="literalblock">

<li>
<p>Jehovah Commanding Moses to Make a Fiery Serpent and Set It on a Pole That Everyone Who Was Bitten Might Look at It and Live</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This bronze serpent typifies Christ (John 3:14), and the pole typifies the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). In typology bronze, or brass, signifies judgment.</pre>

<pre>In Numbers 20 we have a type of Christ as the crucified and resurrected One flowing out the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, but in Numbers 21 we have a type of Christ as our replacement and substitute.</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The bronze serpent on the pole indicated that the children of Israel, who had become serpentine, were put on the pole where they were replaced by something that had the form but not the nature of a serpent.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>If we are drinking of the living water, then we are no longer serpents. But if we are short of the living water, then we are contending serpents.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>Apart from the life-giving Spirit, we are contending serpents. In the church life we may be either contending serpents or life-giving-Spirit drinkers. May we all be those who drink of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit!</pre>
