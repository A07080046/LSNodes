# note
in last week's message i have seen that we need devote ourself as the nazarize. continue the foregoing message we see that god told mose that he need to tell aron and his sons the things of blessing. god will bless them, god's face will shine upon them and be gracious to them, god's countenance will lift up upon them and be peace to them. so after we pass through three steps, dealing with the defilement, undergoing the test of
suspicion, making a vow to be nazarize. we have overcomed the worldld enjoyment, earthly pleasure, self affaction,rebellion and the sudden death. we can receive god's blessing.
actually god's blessin is god himself. he is devine trinity, pass through many steps. so if we want to receive him as our blessing, we need come to the position and standard. there is a flow in the entire bible, flow from father the source, pass through son the transport, to the spirit the new city. step by step, god dispense himself into us. enventually, all of his believers will become the consumation. we can enjoy him, live him and express him. this is the biggest blessing in the universe.
god himself is the only blessing, apart from him every thing is empty and vanity. the blessing is not the outward and material blessing. at this point, god not tell the children of isral that he will give them good land to live, good products to enjoy. but we konw that god bless them, be with them, lift up his countenance to them.
so in our experience, the blessing is not a good job, a beautifll hourse, even not the spritual things. but is himself.
