now i stand at a cross, i need to select one path to walk. first i can change a nother company to do the same work, the life also is the same as before. second i can select a
relative job on abroad which need my english, this may get a higher income. third i can change a nother field, i can teach english. but it is hard at the beginning, if i have 20 students, my income will be the same as now but i can save many time. 
i am nothing, it is he who save me from my deadened situation. he empower my, heal my sick.
the world want to distrovy me. but he want to express his glory in my weakness. i belong to
him now, want can i do, want can i select. 
maybe i like the material riches, but i know i wll have no satisfaction. please give me youself, give my you deal presence. help me to feel you, to know you guidance. i put me 
on you hand, please gain me. help me to apprehand you and your riches.
