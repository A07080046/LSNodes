<p>Falling on His Face</p>

<p>Standing on the Position of God&#x2019;s Deputy Authority-He rebuked Korah and all his company and charged them to be present before Jehovah with their censers, referred this case to God as the highest authority for His speaking, exposure, and judgment.</p>

<li>
<p>Ambition is a &quot;gopher&quot; that undermines God&#x2019;s plan and damages His people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I admire Moses&apos; boldness in confronting this problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because he was the target, it was difficult for him to say anything concerning himself without vindicating, and it was difficult to say anything about others without condemning. So the best way, he said, was not to say anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though Brother Nee was the one under attack, it was the church that was damaged, and it was God&#x2019;s plan that was hurt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a very crucial time, when the Lord told His followers what would happen to Him (Matt. 20:17-19). They heard Him, but they neither listened to what He said nor cared about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you read through the Acts and the Epistles, you will see that this struggle for power was there from the beginning of the church life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power. This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the rebels among the children of Israel in Numbers. we must believe that the struggle for power was in every one of the sons of Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elders know that if they serve in a certain local church for several years, they will surely offend others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those in the church life or in the Lord&#x2019;s work who are somewhat in the position of taking the lead will unavoidably offend some who are greedy for power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although he fell on his face, he still did something. He brought this matter openly to God, to let God come in to speak, to judge, and to vindicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they accused Moses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What should we do in this kind of situation? it is better not to do anything. The Lord is still living. He is still on the throne and is still sovereign. He is the sovereign Lord and the highest authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But by His mercy we are here.</p>

<p>No matter what is happening on earth, God&#x2019;s government still stands.</p>

<p>In chapter sixteen of Numbers, God&#x2019;s judgment is threefold, coming from the earth, from heaven, and from within the people themselves.</p>

<p>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were not afraid because of what they had done. The fact that their tents were close together indicates that they were very intimate.</p>

<p>By this we can see that the rebellion was quite popular, even universal. Immediately after the three leaders were swallowed up alive by the earth, fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred fifty men while they were offering incense (v. 35). This was the second aspect of God&#x2019;s judgment.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Moses and Aaron did something as an emergency measure. Nevertheless, fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people were killed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, even after the third judgment the people still complained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God&#x2019;s judgment does not subdue people; rather, it consumes them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For God to forgive is one thing, and for Him to punish is another. In a particular situation God forgives, but He forgives through punishment; hence, this is a forgiveness with punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to have a holy fear before God. We should bow down and humble ourselves before Him and pray, &quot;Lord, have mercy on me. Only Your mercy can preserve me and keep me in Your grace.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>In Numbers 17 we have God&#x2019;s vindication. Before we consider this matter, I would like to add a word concerning the descendants of Korah.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Numbers 16 seems to indicate that all of Korah&#x2019;s family, including his children, perished. But Numbers 26:11 tells us that the sons of Korah did not die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1 Chronicles 6:33-37, a record of the genealogy of Samuel, we are told that Samuel was a descendant of Korah. Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, as the title of Psalm 88 indicates,a grandson of Samuel (1 Chron. 6:33). Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David&#x2019;s arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we can see that God is severe to some but merciful to others. Whether we experience His mercy or His severity depends on how we behave ourselves.</p>

<li>
<p>It was God&#x2019;s intention that this budding of a dead rod would cause the murmurings of the people to cease.</p>
</li>

<p>Sometimes, for His vindication, God puts us into a dark night, a dark tunnel, through which we must pass.</p>

<p>The Rebellious Nature of the People of Israel Being Exposed to the Uttermost</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>This indicates that even after seeing God&#x2019;s judgment and vindication, the people were not subdued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is no wonder that these children of Israel were not permitted to enter the promised land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As chapter seventeen reveals, this case ends with the punished people not being subdued. Therefore, even God gave them up and let them go. They simply let the people be as they were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not expect to see an ending of turmoil. Although a particular storm will end, those who become involved in that storm may not cease their rebellion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rebellious nature in man is Satan himself. Only one person, Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and also the Son of Man, can defeat this evil one, and He has defeated him (Heb. 2:14).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Paul was about to be martyred, he wrote to Timothy, in his last Epistle, saying that all the people in Asia had left him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have emphasized the fact that, even after God&#x2019;s judgment and vindication, the children of Israel continued to speak words of rebellion. Numbers 17 portrays a sad picture concerning this rebellion. After seeing such a picture, we can only worship God, and worship Him as the Lord.</p>

<p>The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning ourselves, we need to realize that without the Lord&#x2019;s mercy and grace we might be the same as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. But by His mercy we are here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to be continually on the alert by watching and praying. We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside.</p>

<p>a grandson of Samuel. Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David&#x2019;s arrangement.</p>
