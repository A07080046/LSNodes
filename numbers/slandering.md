# MESSAGE NINETEEN JOURNEYING(4)

## C. Slandering
	(one problem after another, the motive for quite a time)
### 1. Moses Having Married a Cushite Woman
	(less message about this)
### 2. Miriam and Aaron Speaking against Moses, the Deputy Authority of God
	From this we need to learn that in the service of the Lord we should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. Any such thing that is not rooted out of our being will come out sooner or later. We need to be alert and aware of any germs that may still be in us. We may seem to be very good, but when certain winds begin to blow or when a particular "storm" or turmoil arises, we may be affected and involved. Then, like Miriam and Aaron, we will be exposed.
#### a. Because of Jealousy
	 Being older than Moses, in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received. 
	Hence, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God's oracle. You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God's oracle.
	 Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God's spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the "sickness" in Numbers 12. Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God's servants.
	 Because of Moses' timidity, God gave Aaron to Moses as his helper (Exo. 4:10-16; 6:30—7:1). However, this does not mean that He appointed Aaron to be His authority. According to God's governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses. But they rebelled.
#### b. Taking Moses' Apparent Mistake as an Excuse
	They were in rivalry with Moses. This, not the Cushite woman, was the real factor in their speaking against Moses.
### 3. Moses Being Very Meek, More Than All Men Who Were on the Face of the Earth
	Moses was such a person; he did not fight or strive.
	It is difficult to find the frank faithfulness of one who serves God according to what God says.
### 4. God Intervening In Numbers 12:5-9 God intervened.
#### a. Coming Down in a Pillar of Cloud and Standing at the Entrance of the Tent, Speaking to Aaron and Miriam
	To touch, defy, or challenge God's authority is to shake God's throne. This is very serious, much more serious than murmuring evil and lusting for meat.
#### b. Vindicating Moses
	God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house (v. 7). 
#### c. Rebuking Aaron and Miriam
	God rebuked Aaron and Miriam. He asked them, "Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?" (v. 8b). The anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed from them (v. 9).
### 5. Miriam Being Punished
	 First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator, the initiator, who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam.
#### a. Being Made Sick of Leprosy
	, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous" (v. 10). This was God's governmental dealing.
#### b. Aaron Begging Moses for Her
	we should learn from this not to follow an instigator. If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf.
	In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly. 
### 6. Moses Praying for Miriam's Healing
	Moses prayed for Miriam's healing, saying, "Heal her, O God, I beg You" (v. 13). This is a further indication of Moses' meekness. If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy. 
	 The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again (v. 15b). 
	The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today.
