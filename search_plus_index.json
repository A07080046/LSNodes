Compared with the Blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 (compare) (he is blessing) note in last week’s message i have seen that we need devote ourself as the nazarize. continue the foregoing message we see that god told mose that he need to tell aron and his sons the things of blessing. god will bless them, god’s face will shine upon them and be gracious to them, god’s countenance will lift up upon them and be peace to them. so after we pass through three steps, dealing with the defilement, undergoing the test of suspicion, making a vow to be nazarize. we have overcomed the worldld enjoyment, earthly pleasure, self affaction,rebellion and the sudden death. we can receive god’s blessing. actually god’s blessin is god himself. he is devine trinity, pass through many steps. so if we want to receive him as our blessing, we need come to the position and standard. there is a flow in the entire bible, flow from father the source, pass through son the transport, to the spirit the new city. step by step, god dispense himself into us. enventually, all of his believers will become the consumation. we can enjoy him, live him and express him. this is the biggest blessing in the universe. god himself is the only blessing, apart from him every thing is empty and vanity. the blessing is not the outward and material blessing. at this point, god not tell the children of isral that he will give them good land to live, good products to enjoy. but we konw that god bless them, be with them, lift up his countenance to them. so in our experience, the blessing is not a good job, a beautifll hourse, even not the spritual things. but is himself.

Any such thing that is not rooted out of our being will come out sooner or later. We need to be alert and aware of any germs that may still be in us. We may seem to be very good, but when certain winds begin to blow or when a particular \"storm\" or turmoil arises, we may be affected and involved. Then, like Miriam and Aaron, we will be exposed. a.Because of Jealousy Being older than Moses, in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received. Hence, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God’s oracle. You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God’s oracle. Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God’s spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the \"sickness\" in Numbers 12. Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God’s servants. Because of Moses' timidity [tɪ'mɪdətɪ], God gave Aaron to Moses as his helper (Exo. 4:10-16; 6:30—7:1). However, this does not mean that He appointed Aaron to be His authority. According to God’s governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses. But they rebelled. b.Taking Moses' Apparent Mistake as an Excuse They were in rivalry with Moses. This, not the Cushite woman, was the real factor in their speaking against Moses. 3.Moses Being Very Meek, More Than All Men Who Were on the Face of the Earth Moses was such a person; he did not fight or strive. It is difficult to find the frank faithfulness of one who serves God according to what God says. 4.God Intervening In Numbers 12:5-9 God intervened. a.Coming Down in a Pillar of Cloud and Standing at the Entrance of the Tent, Speaking to Aaron and Miriam To touch, defy, or challenge God’s authority is to shake God’s throne. This is very serious, much more serious than murmuring evil and lusting for meat. b.Vindicating Moses God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house (v. 7). c.Rebuking Aaron and Miriam God rebuked Aaron and Miriam. He asked them, \"Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?\" (v. 8b). The anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed from them (v. 9). 5.Miriam Being Punished First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator [ˈɪnstɪgeɪtə(r)], the initiator [ɪˈnɪʃieɪtə(r)], who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam. a.Being Made Sick of Leprosy Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous\" (v. 10). This was God’s governmental dealing. b.Aaron Begging Moses for Her we should learn from this not to follow an instigator. If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf. In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly[ˈfɒli]. 6.Moses Praying for Miriam’s Healing Moses prayed for Miriam’s healing, saying, \"Heal her, O God, I beg You\" (v. 13). This is a further indication of Moses' meekness. If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy. The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again (v. 15b). The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today. note background murmur their misfortune→burn and consume some at the ourskirts of the camp mixed multitude lust meat, even israel weep and want to eat meat, remember the food in egypt, have no appetite→many quails,stuck with severe [sɪˈvɪə(r)] plague [pleɪɡ] mose burden too heavy →elders,assistants many problem turmoil[ˈtɜːmɔɪl]chaos detail resson surface:marriage inner:Jealousy,rivalry [ˈraɪvlri] process speak against meek,on the Face of the Earth Intervening [ˌɪntəˈvi:nɪŋ] Coming Down in pillar stand at entrance Vindicating [ˈvɪndɪˌkeɪtɪŋ] :meek,oracle speak face to face, [ˈɒrəkl],faithful in house Rebuking [riˈbju:kɪŋ] no afraid my servant Punished was leprous Praying for Miriam’s Healing result miriam:leprosy aaron:beg,folly mose:pray for,cry to all:delayed on the march lesson should not complain, murmur circumstances, situation should not fill lust and appetite[ˈæpɪtaɪt] should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. be alert and aware of any germs[dʒɜ:rms] that may still be in us speak now we come to today’s topic, the failture of slandering. first we come to the background of this failture. in the foregoing message we have seen that there are so many problems, one after another. first the people of the skirtout of the camp murmur evils. the complain their circumtance and situation. maybe they say that they are so bitter. live is suffering. then god’s anger was kindled and god make fire to cusume them. then the mixed multitudes lusting meat, even the children of israel also want to eat meat. they feel that the manna is tasteless, they have no appetite, they want to eat meat. and they rememer the food which the eat at egypt. the god give them many quails, and a servery plague come to them. and mose also said that his burden is so heavy, he can’t bear. and he marrage a cusite woman, these things make the situation become turmoil and chaos. at this juncture, annan and his sister miriam speak against mose. reproach that mose have married a cusite woman. but the marrage is not the true reason, the real reason is their jealousy, the want to receive more respect than mose. the compete with mose, this is a rivalry. they speaked that it is not only god speak to mose, but also speak to them. face this situation, mose is very meek, he didn’t struggle or strive. but god comed down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the camp. he was vidicating for mose, god said that he speaks with mose face to face, mose is faithful in his house. he was rebuting them by said that you are no afraid to speak against my servant? then depart from them, and miriam become leperous. as white as snow. annan beged for his sister to mose, and mose cried to god, and pray for her. but it needs seven days to cure her leper. and the march was delayed by her. from this failture, we need to learn some lessons. first we should not complain or murmur our situation. second we should not fill our lust and appetite. if we lust meat, we wil be punished by plague. third we should not allow any nigative thins hidden in our inner being, we need alert and aware of any germs within us. because they will be exposed in the future. we need god to deal with the germs in us.

REBELLION—A MORE SERIOUS FAILURE murmuring of evil at the border of the camp lusting mixed multitud speak against two elder relatives unbelief in spying out the land 12 leaders rebellion more than two hundred fifty people. A. who rebel. Korah-a leader among the Levites Dathan, Abiram, and On- they lead among the sons of Israel according to their natural birth Two Hundred Fifty Leaders of the Assembly-They had been chosen from the congregation and were well-known men B. The Cause of the Rebellion The Struggle for Position and Power The Accusation C. The Reaction of Moses Falling on His Face Standing on the Position of God’s Deputy Authority-He rebuked Korah and all his company and charged them to be present before Jehovah with their censers, referred this case to God as the highest authority for His speaking, exposure, and judgment. Being Very Angry-Here it seems that Moses was forced to vindicate himself, but God did not condemn him for this. Sending to Call Dathan and Abiram they would not come up Ambition is a \"gopher\" that undermines God’s plan and damages His people. I admire Moses' boldness in confronting this problem. because he was the target, it was difficult for him to say anything concerning himself without vindicating, and it was difficult to say anything about others without condemning. So the best way, he said, was not to say anything. Even though Brother Nee was the one under attack, it was the church that was damaged, and it was God’s plan that was hurt. The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females. At a very crucial time, when the Lord told His followers what would happen to Him (Matt. 20:17-19). They heard Him, but they neither listened to what He said nor cared about it. If you read through the Acts and the Epistles, you will see that this struggle for power was there from the beginning of the church life. The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power. This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you. Consider the rebels among the children of Israel in Numbers. we must believe that the struggle for power was in every one of the sons of Israel. The elders know that if they serve in a certain local church for several years, they will surely offend others. Those in the church life or in the Lord’s work who are somewhat in the position of taking the lead will unavoidably offend some who are greedy for power. Although he fell on his face, he still did something. He brought this matter openly to God, to let God come in to speak, to judge, and to vindicate. they accused Moses. What should we do in this kind of situation? it is better not to do anything. The Lord is still living. He is still on the throne and is still sovereign. He is the sovereign Lord and the highest authority. But by His mercy we are here. In this message we will see how God judged this rebellion D. God’s Judgment No matter what is happening on earth, God’s government still stands. In chapter sixteen of Numbers, God’s judgment is threefold, coming from the earth, from heaven, and from within the people themselves. Korah Gathering All the Assembly against Moses and Aaron-This forced God to come out and appear in His glory to all the assembly. God is the God not of the flesh of people but of their spirit. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Together with Their Wives, Their Sons, and Their Little Ones, and All the Men That Belonged to Korah and All Their Goods, Being Swallowed by the Earth and Going Down Alive into Sheol Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were not afraid because of what they had done. The fact that their tents were close together indicates that they were very intimate. Probably this is the only time that living people were punished in such a way. Fire Coming Forth from Jehovah and Consuming the Two Hundred Fifty Men Offering the Incense By this we can see that the rebellion was quite popular, even universal. Immediately after the three leaders were swallowed up alive by the earth, fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred fifty men while they were offering incense (v. 35). This was the second aspect of God’s judgment. The Censers of the Two Hundred Fifty Men Being Holy and Being Made into Hammered Plates as a Covering for the Altar When the people came to offer at the altar, they were reminded of the rebellion and of God’s judgment on Korah and his company. The Exposure of the Unsubdued Rebellious Nature of the People of Israel On the Next Day All the Assembly of the Sons of Israel Murmuring against Moses and Aaron God’s Intervening-His glory appeared in the cloud that covered the tent of meeting The germs of the plague were probably in them already. The Propitiation for the Sons of Israel through Moses and Aaron At this juncture, Moses and Aaron did something as an emergency measure. Nevertheless, fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people were killed. However, even after the third judgment the people still complained God’s judgment does not subdue people; rather, it consumes them. For God to forgive is one thing, and for Him to punish is another. In a particular situation God forgives, but He forgives through punishment; hence, this is a forgiveness with punishment. We need to have a holy fear before God. We should bow down and humble ourselves before Him and pray, \"Lord, have mercy on me. Only Your mercy can preserve me and keep me in Your grace.\" In Numbers 17 we have God’s vindication. Before we consider this matter, I would like to add a word concerning the descendants of Korah. Numbers 16 seems to indicate that all of Korah’s family, including his children, perished. But Numbers 26:11 tells us that the sons of Korah did not die. In 1 Chronicles 6:33-37, a record of the genealogy of Samuel, we are told that Samuel was a descendant of Korah. Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet. Furthermore, as the title of Psalm 88 indicates,a grandson of Samuel (1 Chron. 6:33). Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David’s arrangement. we can see that God is severe to some but merciful to others. Whether we experience His mercy or His severity depends on how we behave ourselves. E. God’s Vindication In chapter seventeen God went further to vindicate Aaron and Moses, His deputy authority, in a positive way. After His Judgment, God Commanding That Twelve Rods Be Laid before the Testimony This signifies that everything had to be brought into the presence of God to let God deal with the real situation by speaking the truth to all the people through His vindication. It was God’s intention that this budding of a dead rod would cause the murmurings of the people to cease. Sometimes, for His vindication, God puts us into a dark night, a dark tunnel, through which we must pass. Aaron’s Rod Budding Aaron’s dead, dried up rod budded. This was an organic miracle. Moses brought all the rods to all the sons of Israel, and they all looked (v. 9). The record indicates that, without saying a word and without praising the Lord for His vindication, each man took his rod. The Budding Rod of Aaron Being Put Back before the Testimony The budding rod of Aaron was put back before the testimony To Be Kept as a Sign for the Sons of Rebellion Verse 5 refers to the murmurings as being against Moses, but verse 10 refers to them as being against God. whatever happened in the Old Testament on the positive side was related to Christ. Today He is still budding, and we are a small part, the fruit, the almonds, of His budding. The Rebellious Nature of the People of Israel Being Exposed to the Uttermost This indicates that even after seeing God’s judgment and vindication, the people were not subdued. It is no wonder that these children of Israel were not permitted to enter the promised land. As chapter seventeen reveals, this case ends with the punished people not being subdued. Therefore, even God gave them up and let them go. They simply let the people be as they were. Do not expect to see an ending of turmoil. Although a particular storm will end, those who become involved in that storm may not cease their rebellion. The rebellious nature in man is Satan himself. Only one person, Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and also the Son of Man, can defeat this evil one, and He has defeated him (Heb. 2:14). We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside. When Paul was about to be martyred, he wrote to Timothy, in his last Epistle, saying that all the people in Asia had left him We have emphasized the fact that, even after God’s judgment and vindication, the children of Israel continued to speak words of rebellion. Numbers 17 portrays a sad picture concerning this rebellion. After seeing such a picture, we can only worship God, and worship Him as the Lord. note the people Korah Dathan, Abiram, and On Two Hundred Fifty Leaders of the Assembly the reason The Struggle for Position and Power The Accusation:you take too much upon yourselves, for all the assembly are holy, every one of them , and jehoval is among them. why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of jehoval. mose’s reaction felling on his face standing on the Position of God’s Deputy Authority rebuke: you take too much upon yourselves charge: take cencers, referred this case to God them didn’t come up, very angry: do not regard their offering god’s reaction judgement earth: the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all the belongs to them. heaven: fire came forth from jehovah and consumed the 250 men within the people: accuse mose, plague 14700 vindication[ˌvɪndɪ'keɪʃn] rod before testmoney rod budded produced blossom [ˈblɒsəm] bore ripe almonds[ˈɑ:məndz] rod put back testmoney, as a sign against the rebels expose the rebelious nature to the uttermost lessons The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females. This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you. Concerning ourselves, we need to realize that without the Lord’s mercy and grace we might be the same as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. But by His mercy we are here. We need to be continually on the alert by watching and praying. We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside. one of his descendants became a priest, not by struggling for power but by being offered as a Nazarite. Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet. a grandson of Samuel. Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David’s arrangement. ## speak "}}
