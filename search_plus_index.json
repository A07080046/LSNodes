These verses cover the matter of being blessed by God in His divine trinity. VIII. BEING BLESSED BY GOD (through three steps) (overcome four things) A. By God in His Divine Trinity (match standard) (what) (trinity for dispense) (how) (issue) (consummation) (verses) (grace and peace) (christ) (eternal) (give in trinity,only blessing) 1. In the Father—\"Jehovah Bless You and Keep You\" (love,power) (keep) 2. In the Son—\"Jehovah Make His Face to Shine upon You and Be Gracious to You\" (shine) (presence) (grace) 3. In the Spirit—\"Jehovah Lift Up His Countenance upon You and Give You Peace\" (face, counteance) (sum) (not material) (sum) B. Compared with the Blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 (compare) (he is blessing) note in last week's message i have seen that we need devote ourself as the nazarize. continue the foregoing message we see that god told mose that he need to tell aron and his sons the things of blessing. god will bless them, god's face will shine upon them and be gracious to them, god's countenance will lift up upon them and be peace to them. so after we pass through three steps, dealing with the defilement, undergoing the test of suspicion, making a vow to be nazarize. we have overcomed the worldld enjoyment, earthly pleasure, self affaction,rebellion and the sudden death. we can receive god's blessing. actually god's blessin is god himself. he is devine trinity, pass through many steps. so if we want to receive him as our blessing, we need come to the position and standard. there is a flow in the entire bible, flow from father the source, pass through son the transport, to the spirit the new city. step by step, god dispense himself into us. enventually, all of his believers will become the consumation. we can enjoy him, live him and express him. this is the biggest blessing in the universe. god himself is the only blessing, apart from him every thing is empty and vanity. the blessing is not the outward and material blessing. at this point, god not tell the children of isral that he will give them good land to live, good products to enjoy. but we konw that god bless them, be with them, lift up his countenance to them. so in our experience, the blessing is not a good job, a beautifll hourse, even not the spritual things. but is himself.

Slandering one problem after another, the motive for quite a time 1. Moses Having Married a Cushite Woman (less message about this) 2. Miriam and Aaron Speaking against Moses, the Deputy Authority of God From this we need to learn that in the service of the Lord we should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. Any such thing that is not rooted out of our being will come out sooner or later. We need to be alert and aware of any germs that may still be in us. We may seem to be very good, but when certain winds begin to blow or when a particular \"storm\" or turmoil arises, we may be affected and involved. Then, like Miriam and Aaron, we will be exposed. a. Because of Jealousy Being older than Moses, in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received. Hence, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God's oracle. You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God's oracle. Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God's spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the \"sickness\" in Numbers 12. Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God's servants. Because of Moses' timidity [tɪ'mɪdətɪ], God gave Aaron to Moses as his helper (Exo. 4:10-16; 6:30—7:1). However, this does not mean that He appointed Aaron to be His authority. According to God's governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses. But they rebelled. b. Taking Moses' Apparent Mistake as an Excuse They were in rivalry with Moses. This, not the Cushite woman, was the real factor in their speaking against Moses. 3. Moses Being Very Meek, More Than All Men Who Were on the Face of the Earth Moses was such a person; he did not fight or strive. It is difficult to find the frank faithfulness of one who serves God according to what God says. 4. God Intervening In Numbers 12:5-9 God intervened. a. Coming Down in a Pillar of Cloud and Standing at the Entrance of the Tent, Speaking to Aaron and Miriam To touch, defy, or challenge God's authority is to shake God's throne. This is very serious, much more serious than murmuring evil and lusting for meat. b. Vindicating Moses God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house (v. 7). c. Rebuking Aaron and Miriam God rebuked Aaron and Miriam. He asked them, \"Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?\" (v. 8b). The anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed from them (v. 9). 5. Miriam Being Punished First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator [ˈɪnstɪgeɪtə(r)], the initiator [ɪˈnɪʃieɪtə(r)], who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam. a. Being Made Sick of Leprosy , Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous\" (v. 10). This was God's governmental dealing. b. Aaron Begging Moses for Her we should learn from this not to follow an instigator. If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf. In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly[ˈfɒli]. 6. Moses Praying for Miriam's Healing Moses prayed for Miriam's healing, saying, \"Heal her, O God, I beg You\" (v. 13). This is a further indication of Moses' meekness. If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy. The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again (v. 15b). The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today. note background murmur their misfortune->burn and consume some at the ourskirts of the camp mixed multitude lust meat, even israel weep and want to eat meat, remember the food in egypt, have no appetite->many quails,stuck with severe [sɪˈvɪə(r)] plague [pleɪɡ] mose burden too heavy ->elders,assistants many problem, turmoil[ˈtɜːmɔɪl]chaos detail resson surface:marriage inner:Jealousy,rivalry [ˈraɪvlri] process speak against meek,on the Face of the Earth Intervening [ˌɪntəˈvi:nɪŋ] Coming Down stand Vindicating [ˈvɪndɪˌkeɪtɪŋ] :meek,oracle speak face to face, [ˈɒrəkl],faithful in house Rebuking [riˈbju:kɪŋ] no afraid my servant Punished was leprous Praying for Miriam's Healing result miriam:leprosy aaron:beg,folly mose:pray for,cry to all:delayed on the march lesson should not complain, murmur circumstances, situation should not fill lust and appetite[ˈæpɪtaɪt] should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. be alert and aware of any germs[dʒɜ:rms] that may still be in us "}}
