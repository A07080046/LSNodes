Compared with the Blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 (compare) (he is blessing) note in last week’s message i have seen that we need devote ourself as the nazarize. continue the foregoing message we see that god told mose that he need to tell aron and his sons the things of blessing. god will bless them, god’s face will shine upon them and be gracious to them, god’s countenance will lift up upon them and be peace to them. so after we pass through three steps, dealing with the defilement, undergoing the test of suspicion, making a vow to be nazarize. we have overcomed the worldld enjoyment, earthly pleasure, self affaction,rebellion and the sudden death. we can receive god’s blessing. actually god’s blessin is god himself. he is devine trinity, pass through many steps. so if we want to receive him as our blessing, we need come to the position and standard. there is a flow in the entire bible, flow from father the source, pass through son the transport, to the spirit the new city. step by step, god dispense himself into us. enventually, all of his believers will become the consumation. we can enjoy him, live him and express him. this is the biggest blessing in the universe. god himself is the only blessing, apart from him every thing is empty and vanity. the blessing is not the outward and material blessing. at this point, god not tell the children of isral that he will give them good land to live, good products to enjoy. but we konw that god bless them, be with them, lift up his countenance to them. so in our experience, the blessing is not a good job, a beautifll hourse, even not the spritual things. but is himself.

Any such thing that is not rooted out of our being will come out sooner or later. We need to be alert and aware of any germs that may still be in us. We may seem to be very good, but when certain winds begin to blow or when a particular \"storm\" or turmoil arises, we may be affected and involved. Then, like Miriam and Aaron, we will be exposed. a.Because of Jealousy Being older than Moses, in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received. Hence, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God’s oracle. You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God’s oracle. Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God’s spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the \"sickness\" in Numbers 12. Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God’s servants. Because of Moses' timidity [tɪ'mɪdətɪ], God gave Aaron to Moses as his helper (Exo. 4:10-16; 6:30—7:1). However, this does not mean that He appointed Aaron to be His authority. According to God’s governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses. But they rebelled. b.Taking Moses' Apparent Mistake as an Excuse They were in rivalry with Moses. This, not the Cushite woman, was the real factor in their speaking against Moses. 3.Moses Being Very Meek, More Than All Men Who Were on the Face of the Earth Moses was such a person; he did not fight or strive. It is difficult to find the frank faithfulness of one who serves God according to what God says. 4.God Intervening In Numbers 12:5-9 God intervened. a.Coming Down in a Pillar of Cloud and Standing at the Entrance of the Tent, Speaking to Aaron and Miriam To touch, defy, or challenge God’s authority is to shake God’s throne. This is very serious, much more serious than murmuring evil and lusting for meat. b.Vindicating Moses God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house (v. 7). c.Rebuking Aaron and Miriam God rebuked Aaron and Miriam. He asked them, \"Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?\" (v. 8b). The anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed from them (v. 9). 5.Miriam Being Punished First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator [ˈɪnstɪgeɪtə(r)], the initiator [ɪˈnɪʃieɪtə(r)], who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam. a.Being Made Sick of Leprosy Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous\" (v. 10). This was God’s governmental dealing. b.Aaron Begging Moses for Her we should learn from this not to follow an instigator. If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf. In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly[ˈfɒli]. 6.Moses Praying for Miriam’s Healing Moses prayed for Miriam’s healing, saying, \"Heal her, O God, I beg You\" (v. 13). This is a further indication of Moses' meekness. If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy. The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again (v. 15b). The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today. note background murmur their misfortune→burn and consume some at the ourskirts of the camp mixed multitude lust meat, even israel weep and want to eat meat, remember the food in egypt, have no appetite→many quails,stuck with severe [sɪˈvɪə(r)] plague [pleɪɡ] mose burden too heavy →elders,assistants many problem turmoil[ˈtɜːmɔɪl]chaos detail resson surface:marriage inner:Jealousy,rivalry [ˈraɪvlri] process speak against meek,on the Face of the Earth Intervening [ˌɪntəˈvi:nɪŋ] Coming Down in pillar stand at entrance Vindicating [ˈvɪndɪˌkeɪtɪŋ] :meek,oracle speak face to face, [ˈɒrəkl],faithful in house Rebuking [riˈbju:kɪŋ] no afraid my servant Punished was leprous Praying for Miriam’s Healing result miriam:leprosy aaron:beg,folly mose:pray for,cry to all:delayed on the march lesson should not complain, murmur circumstances, situation should not fill lust and appetite[ˈæpɪtaɪt] should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. be alert and aware of any germs[dʒɜ:rms] that may still be in us speak now we come to today’s topic, the failture of slandering. first we come to the background of this failture. in the foregoing message we have seen that there are so many problems, one after another. first the people of the skirtout of the camp murmur evils. the complain their circumtance and situation. maybe they say that they are so bitter. live is suffering. then god’s anger was kindled and god make fire to cusume them. then the mixed multitudes lusting meat, even the children of israel also want to eat meat. they feel that the manna is tasteless, they have no appetite, they want to eat meat. and they rememer the food which the eat at egypt. the god give them many quails, and a servery plague come to them. and mose also said that his burden is so heavy, he can’t bear. and he marrage a cusite woman, these things make the situation become turmoil and chaos. at this juncture, annan and his sister miriam speak against mose. reproach that mose have married a cusite woman. but the marrage is not the true reason, the real reason is their jealousy, the want to receive more respect than mose. the compete with mose, this is a rivalry. they speaked that it is not only god speak to mose, but also speak to them. face this situation, mose is very meek, he didn’t struggle or strive. but god comed down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the camp. he was vidicating for mose, god said that he speaks with mose face to face, mose is faithful in his house. he was rebuting them by said that you are no afraid to speak against my servant? then depart from them, and miriam become leperous. as white as snow. annan beged for his sister to mose, and mose cried to god, and pray for her. but it needs seven days to cure her leper. and the march was delayed by her. from this failture, we need to learn some lessons. first we should not complain or murmur our situation. second we should not fill our lust and appetite. if we lust meat, we wil be punished by plague. third we should not allow any nigative thins hidden in our inner being, we need alert and aware of any germs within us. because they will be exposed in the future. we need god to deal with the germs in us.

A MORE SERIOUS FAILURE murmuring of evil at the border of the camp lusting mixed multitud speak against two elder relatives unbelief in spying out the land 12 leaders rebellion more than two hundred fifty people. A. who rebel Korah-a leader among the Levites Dathan, Abiram, and On- they lead among the sons of Israel according to their natural birth Two Hundred Fifty Leaders of the Assembly-They had been chosen from the congregation and were well-known men B. The Cause of the Rebellion The Struggle for Position and Power The Accusation C. The Reaction of Moses Falling on His Face Standing on the Position of God’s Deputy Authority-He rebuked Korah and all his company and charged them to be present before Jehovah with their censers, referred this case to God as the highest authority for His speaking, exposure, and judgment. Being Very Angry-Here it seems that Moses was forced to vindicate himself, but God did not condemn him for this. Sending to Call Dathan and Abiram they would not come up Ambition is a \"gopher\" that undermines God’s plan and damages His people. I admire Moses' boldness in confronting this problem. because he was the target, it was difficult for him to say anything concerning himself without vindicating, and it was difficult to say anything about others without condemning. So the best way, he said, was not to say anything. Even though Brother Nee was the one under attack, it was the church that was damaged, and it was God’s plan that was hurt. The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females. At a very crucial time, when the Lord told His followers what would happen to Him (Matt. 20:17-19). They heard Him, but they neither listened to what He said nor cared about it. If you read through the Acts and the Epistles, you will see that this struggle for power was there from the beginning of the church life. The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power. This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you. Consider the rebels among the children of Israel in Numbers. we must believe that the struggle for power was in every one of the sons of Israel. The elders know that if they serve in a certain local church for several years, they will surely offend others. Those in the church life or in the Lord’s work who are somewhat in the position of taking the lead will unavoidably offend some who are greedy for power. Although he fell on his face, he still did something. He brought this matter openly to God, to let God come in to speak, to judge, and to vindicate. they accused Moses. What should we do in this kind of situation? it is better not to do anything. The Lord is still living. He is still on the throne and is still sovereign. He is the sovereign Lord and the highest authority. But by His mercy we are here. In this message we will see how God judged this rebellion D. God’s Judgment No matter what is happening on earth, God’s government still stands. In chapter sixteen of Numbers, God’s judgment is threefold, coming from the earth, from heaven, and from within the people themselves. Korah Gathering All the Assembly against Moses and Aaron-This forced God to come out and appear in His glory to all the assembly. God is the God not of the flesh of people but of their spirit. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Together with Their Wives, Their Sons, and Their Little Ones, and All the Men That Belonged to Korah and All Their Goods, Being Swallowed by the Earth and Going Down Alive into Sheol Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were not afraid because of what they had done. The fact that their tents were close together indicates that they were very intimate. Probably this is the only time that living people were punished in such a way. Fire Coming Forth from Jehovah and Consuming the Two Hundred Fifty Men Offering the Incense By this we can see that the rebellion was quite popular, even universal. Immediately after the three leaders were swallowed up alive by the earth, fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred fifty men while they were offering incense (v. 35). This was the second aspect of God’s judgment. The Censers of the Two Hundred Fifty Men Being Holy and Being Made into Hammered Plates as a Covering for the Altar When the people came to offer at the altar, they were reminded of the rebellion and of God’s judgment on Korah and his company. The Exposure of the Unsubdued Rebellious Nature of the People of Israel On the Next Day All the Assembly of the Sons of Israel Murmuring against Moses and Aaron God’s Intervening-His glory appeared in the cloud that covered the tent of meeting The germs of the plague were probably in them already. The Propitiation for the Sons of Israel through Moses and Aaron At this juncture, Moses and Aaron did something as an emergency measure. Nevertheless, fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people were killed. However, even after the third judgment the people still complained God’s judgment does not subdue people; rather, it consumes them. For God to forgive is one thing, and for Him to punish is another. In a particular situation God forgives, but He forgives through punishment; hence, this is a forgiveness with punishment. We need to have a holy fear before God. We should bow down and humble ourselves before Him and pray, \"Lord, have mercy on me. Only Your mercy can preserve me and keep me in Your grace.\" In Numbers 17 we have God’s vindication. Before we consider this matter, I would like to add a word concerning the descendants of Korah. Numbers 16 seems to indicate that all of Korah’s family, including his children, perished. But Numbers 26:11 tells us that the sons of Korah did not die. In 1 Chronicles 6:33-37, a record of the genealogy of Samuel, we are told that Samuel was a descendant of Korah. Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet. Furthermore, as the title of Psalm 88 indicates,a grandson of Samuel (1 Chron. 6:33). Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David’s arrangement. we can see that God is severe to some but merciful to others. Whether we experience His mercy or His severity depends on how we behave ourselves. E. God’s Vindication In chapter seventeen God went further to vindicate Aaron and Moses, His deputy authority, in a positive way. After His Judgment, God Commanding That Twelve Rods Be Laid before the Testimony This signifies that everything had to be brought into the presence of God to let God deal with the real situation by speaking the truth to all the people through His vindication. It was God’s intention that this budding of a dead rod would cause the murmurings of the people to cease. Sometimes, for His vindication, God puts us into a dark night, a dark tunnel, through which we must pass. Aaron’s Rod Budding Aaron’s dead, dried up rod budded. This was an organic miracle. Moses brought all the rods to all the sons of Israel, and they all looked (v. 9). The record indicates that, without saying a word and without praising the Lord for His vindication, each man took his rod. The Budding Rod of Aaron Being Put Back before the Testimony The budding rod of Aaron was put back before the testimony To Be Kept as a Sign for the Sons of Rebellion Verse 5 refers to the murmurings as being against Moses, but verse 10 refers to them as being against God. whatever happened in the Old Testament on the positive side was related to Christ. Today He is still budding, and we are a small part, the fruit, the almonds, of His budding. The Rebellious Nature of the People of Israel Being Exposed to the Uttermost This indicates that even after seeing God’s judgment and vindication, the people were not subdued. It is no wonder that these children of Israel were not permitted to enter the promised land. As chapter seventeen reveals, this case ends with the punished people not being subdued. Therefore, even God gave them up and let them go. They simply let the people be as they were. Do not expect to see an ending of turmoil. Although a particular storm will end, those who become involved in that storm may not cease their rebellion. The rebellious nature in man is Satan himself. Only one person, Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and also the Son of Man, can defeat this evil one, and He has defeated him (Heb. 2:14). We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside. When Paul was about to be martyred, he wrote to Timothy, in his last Epistle, saying that all the people in Asia had left him We have emphasized the fact that, even after God’s judgment and vindication, the children of Israel continued to speak words of rebellion. Numbers 17 portrays a sad picture concerning this rebellion. After seeing such a picture, we can only worship God, and worship Him as the Lord. note the people Korah Dathan, Abiram, and On Two Hundred Fifty Leaders of the Assembly the reason The Struggle for Position and Power The Accusation:you take too much upon yourselves, for all the assembly are holy, every one of them , and jehoval is among them. why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of jehoval. mose’s reaction felling on his face standing on the Position of God’s Deputy Authority rebuke: you take too much upon yourselves charge: take cencers, referred this case to God them didn’t come up, very angry: do not regard their offering god’s reaction judgement earth: the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all the belongs to them. heaven: fire came forth from jehovah and consumed the 250 men within the people: accuse mose, plague 14700 vindication[ˌvɪndɪ'keɪʃn] rod before testmoney rod budded produced blossom [ˈblɒsəm] bore ripe almonds[ˈɑ:məndz] rod put back testmoney, as a sign against the rebels expose the rebelious nature to the uttermost lessons The ambition and the struggle are in our blood. we may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you. without the Lord’s mercy and grace we might be the same as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. We have not only the Devil as the enemy on the outside but also Satan as the adversary on the inside. one of his descendants became a priest, by being offered as a Nazarite. Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet. a grandson of Samuel. Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer "},"numbers/moses-angry.html":{"url":"numbers/moses-angry.html","title":"moses’s angry","keywords":"","body":"FURTHER FAILURES Contending for Water Because there was no water for the assembly, the people \"gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron\" (v. 2). The People Contending with Moses with Evil Words Moses and Aaron Leaving the Congregation, Going to the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and Falling on Their Faces Jehovah Commanding Moses to Take the Rod and Speak to the Rock with Aaron before the People That the Rock Might Yield Its Water The rock typifies Christ (1 Cor. 10:4b), and the water typifies the Spirit (1 Cor. 10:4a). Moses Taking the Rod, Calling the People Rebels, and Striking the Rock with His Rod Twice, and Water Coming Out Abundantly Whenever we are angry and do not control ourselves, it is easy for us to make mistakes. At such times we, like Moses, may speak wrongly or act wrongly. Although Moses was a faithful servant of God, in Numbers 20 he made a mistake which caused him to lose his right to enter into the promised good land. God Supplying the Israelites with Manna and Water to Meet Their Proper Need, without Any Punishment, but Supplying Them with Quails to Satisfy Their Lusting after the Flesh, as a Punishment When the children of Israel caused God trouble concerning necessities, He was not offended, but when they lusted, He was offended. Actually, it was His responsibility to supply them with water. Moses Failing to Sanctify God in Being Angry with the People of Israel and in Wrongly Striking the Rock Twice In being angry, he did not represent God rightly in His holy nature toward His people. In striking the rock twice, he represented God wrongly in God's action. we should not pray when we are angry. we learn that we should be careful whenever we pray to God concerning His people. Because he was angry when God was not angry, Moses did not rightly represent God. According to Moses' view in chapter twenty, there was much trouble and iniquity among God's people, but in God's view there was neither trouble nor iniquity. This means that although Moses was usually one with God, in this instance there was a great discrepancy between him and God. His mistaken speaking made God common; that is, it did not sanctify God, did not make Him separate from all other gods. The people were not at fault for being thirsty, and they were not rebelling against Me. You condemned them as rebels, but you are the ones who rebelled against My word.\" We need to learn that, especially when we have been offended by the saints in the church, we should not go to God for the purpose of accusing His people. He is not offended with His people when the lack of water causes them to contend. Even if He must punish His people, He punishes them sparingly. We must not give people the wrong impression concerning the God whom we serve. when Moses, in anger, acted wrongly, he broke the principles of God's economy. This should be a warning to us not to hold on to our anger but to practice Paul's word in Ephesians 4:26: \"Do not let the sun go down on your indignation.\" Moses offended both God's holy nature and divine economy. He represented God wrongly, and he broke the principles of God's economy. We should not offend other saints or stumble them. Whenever we are offended or stumbled, we should be forgiving. If we know only to condemn others and have no intention of forgiving them, we will have trouble. In the church life there is the need of forgiveness. The church life should be a forgiving life. Concerning the Bible we should have a good memory, but concerning others' wrongdoings we should have a poor memory. The blunder committed by Moses in Numbers 20 consisted in not having a positive and pleasant feeling regarding God's people. The lesson we need to learn from Moses' failure in Numbers 20 is that we should be very careful when we speak about God's people. We may think that we are right and that others are wrong. However, God may come in not to vindicate us but to vindicate the ones we condemn. Do not keep a record in your memory of others' offenses. Remembering offenses is risky, for it may cause you to lose your birthright, to lose your right to the enjoyment of Christ as the good land. From the type in this chapter, we may learn to have regard for God's nature and for His administration among His people. If we learn this lesson, we will be careful about speaking in a negative way concerning God's people. 7.. The Significance of the Types The problem in Numbers 20 was due to the lack of the Spirit of life. This indicates that whenever God's people are short of the Spirit of life, they will have trouble. To \"take the rod\" is to apply the death of Christ to ourselves. In striking the rock a second time, Moses made a serious mistake. This act was against God's economy. In God's economy Christ should not be crucified more than once. Christ was crucified under the rod of the law, and now He is the following rock, the life-giving Spirit. To have the living water, we simply need to take the rod and apply it to our situation today. We also need to speak to the rock. Speaking to the rock is a matter of believing. Furthermore, speaking to the rock indicates that we have prayed, not in the way of begging but in the way of believing that the Spirit has already been given. The problems in the church life are solved when we have an abundance of the Spirit of life. The problems between us and others and between us and God are due to our shortage of the Spirit of life. T it is not sufficient for us simply to be right with God; we must also be right in our attitude toward God's people. In order to be right in our attitude, we must know God's nature. We need to realize that in His nature God is fair, bountiful, rich in supply, loving, gracious, and merciful. Whenever we see something in God's people which, to our view, is not right, we need to consider the situation according to God's nature. To receive this supply, there is no need for us to beg or even to pray. We should simply speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock. Today we do not need to beg Him for living water or wait for Him to supply us with water. We just need to come to Him and say, \"Lord, I need Your Spirit. Lord, give me the Spirit of life.\" Whenever we speak to Christ as the rock, telling Him to give us living water, we must have the rod in our hand. This means that as we speak to the rock, we must apply the death of Christ to ourselves and realize that we are crucified persons. Speaking against God and Moses Because the Way Was Hard, the People Being Impatient and Speaking against God and Moses, Mainly concerning the Food Supply From God's point of view, this contending, unlike the contending for water, was not fair. God had not promised that the way through the wilderness would be easy. They should have anticipated a difficult journey. Therefore, God was not happy with them and He punished them. Jehovah Sending Fiery Serpents to Bite the People, so that Many of Them Died The People Repenting to Moses and Asking Him to Pray That God Would Take Away the Serpents from Them In all their journeying, this is the first time the children of Israel confessed their sins. Having confessed their sin in speaking against God and Moses, they asked Moses to pray for them, and he did so. Jehovah Commanding Moses to Make a Fiery Serpent and Set It on a Pole That Everyone Who Was Bitten Might Look at It and Live This bronze serpent typifies Christ (John 3:14), and the pole typifies the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). In typology bronze, or brass, signifies judgment. In Numbers 20 we have a type of Christ as the crucified and resurrected One flowing out the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, but in Numbers 21 we have a type of Christ as our replacement and substitute. The bronze serpent on the pole indicated that the children of Israel, who had become serpentine, were put on the pole where they were replaced by something that had the form but not the nature of a serpent. If we are drinking of the living water, then we are no longer serpents. But if we are short of the living water, then we are contending serpents. Apart from the life-giving Spirit, we are contending serpents. In the church life we may be either contending serpents or life-giving-Spirit drinkers. May we all be those who drink of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit!

They might have said to themselves: \"What will happen when Moses is gone? Who will be his successor?\" Instead of justifying our worry, He might say: \"Be at peace. Do not worry about the turmoil. I know the situation.\" Jehovah Telling Moses to Go Up to the Mountain of Abarim and See the Land Moses could only see the land; he was not permitted to enter into it. Moses to Be Gathered to His Forefathers This gathering was somewhat like a harvesting. Moses was \"ripe,\" and soon he was to be \"harvested.\" This gathering, this harvesting, was to be the end of Moses' life. Moses Having Rebelled against God’s Word Moses could not enter into the good land because, in the wilderness of Zin, he had rebelled against God's word to sanctify Him at the waters before the eyes of Israel (v. 14; 20:10-13). Moses had acted contrary to God's nature and God's economy. This serious failure caused him to lose the right to enter into the land of Canaan. However, Moses will surely be in the kingdom. Due to his failure, his ending was not glorious, but his ministry certainly was glorious. The Successor of Moses Moses Asking Jehovah to Appoint a Man over the Assembly of Israel Moses' concern was not for himself and for the loss of the right to enter into the land. He was not the kind of person who cared so much for himself and his situation. Although he was very old, he was concerned for God's people, realizing that they would be in need of a shepherd.

Joshua to Stand before Eleazar the Priest, Who Would Inquire for Him by the Judgment of the Urim before Jehovah When God brought His people into the wilderness, He spoke to them through Moses. God spoke to Moses face to face. But Joshua, Moses' successor, was to receive guidance not from God by His direct speaking in the way He spoke to Moses, but by the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate worn by Eleazar the priest. Whenever Joshua needed guidance concerning the move of the people, he had to go to the high priest, who then received guidance from God by means of the Urim and the Thummim. Although Joshua was made the leader, he did not have the right to receive the divine instructions directly. Instead, the high priest received God's instructions and then passed them on to Joshua, who was responsible for their execution. God's government among His people was a matter not of autocracy or democracy but theocracy. Moses Doing as Jehovah Commanded Him "}}
