<pre>Knowing that Moses was very old and that he could die at any time, thoughtful Israelites must have been concerned about God&apos;s people and about God&apos;s move with His people.

<pre>Moses could not enter into the good land because, in the wilderness of Zin, he had rebelled against God&apos;s word to sanctify Him at the waters before the eyes of Israel (v. 14; 20:10-13). Moses had acted contrary to God&apos;s nature and God&apos;s economy. This serious failure caused him to lose the right to enter into the land of Canaan. However, Moses will surely be in the kingdom.</pre>

<pre>When God brought His people into the wilderness, He spoke to them through Moses. God spoke to Moses face to face. But Joshua, Moses&apos; successor, was to receive guidance not from God by His direct speaking in the way He spoke to Moses, but by the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate worn by Eleazar the priest. Whenever Joshua needed guidance concerning the move of the people, he had to go to the high priest, who then received guidance from God by means of the Urim and the Thummim.</pre>
